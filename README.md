# CountriesApp-Android

An Android app that makes learning about countries easy and accessible, with features like offline caching to ensure that users can access country information even when they're not connected to the internet. The app fetches countries data from an API and offers users the ability to browse country lists, view detailed information about each country, and search for specific countries using keywords. Sorting options allow for organizing countries based on name, region, population, or area, while users can customize their experience with a choice between a dark and light theme.
